A small script to make your shell prompt rather awesome.

Installing:
1. clone the project. I use ~/.bash.d/ but you can use whatever.
2. source it in your shell config. (usually ~/.bashrc)

I'm working on an installer.

Here's my default, and likely yours until I make a config file for you to use.
Example:
[spaceghost (master) ✗]
/home/spaceghost/.bash.d⚡
