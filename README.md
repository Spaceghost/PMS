Prompt Management System
========================
TODO: âœ“

* Add Ruby Support
* Add Gemset Support
* Clean up git working tree status (staged/unstaged/untracked files)
* Add stash counter
* Make installation script
* Add a 'try it' mode to the installation script
* Perhaps add a TODO executable with TODO files and TODO file detection to PS1
* Add a variable the user could set to disable dirty detection if there are too many submodules and it's slowing their prompt down.
* Add ability to go from one-liner prompt to two line upon entering git repo.
* Figure out why the prompt wraps around on itself and stop that from happening.
* Rewrite to generate a PS1 by using a config that calls functions and sets variables. I have no idea what I'm going to do for that, but rest assured, I will find out.
* Add theme support, probably doable with that config.
* Add plugin support, also through that config.
* Rewrite in ruby. Screw the rest of the world. I'm a rubyist.
