 1. Add Ruby Support ✓
 2. Add Gemset Support ✓
 3. Clean up git working tree status (staged/unstaged changes)
 4. Add stash counter
 5. Make installation script
 6. Add a 'test' mode to the installation script
 7. Add continuous integration into the mix
 8. Perhaps add a TODO executable with TODO files and TODO file detection to PS1
 9. Add a variable the user could set to disable dirty detection if there are too many submodules and it's slowing their prompt down.
10. Add ability to go from one-liner prompt to two line upon entering git repo.
11. Figure out why the prompt wraps around on itself and stop that from happening.
12. Rewrite to generate a PS1 by using a config that calls functions and sets variables. I have no idea what I'm going to do for that, but rest assured, I will find out.
13. Add theme support, probably doable with that config.
14. Add plugin support, also through that config.
15. Rewrite in ruby. Screw the rest of the world. I'm a rubyist.
